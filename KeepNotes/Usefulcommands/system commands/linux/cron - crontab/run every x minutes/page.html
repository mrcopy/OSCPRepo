<title>Run Every X Minutes</title>
</head><body>5 * * * * /home/aspera/my_script.sh<br/>
<br/>
What the above shows, per column:<br/>
<br/>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Minute to run on, a value of 0-59: 5 means on the 5th minute of the hour<br/>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The Hour, a value of 0-23: * means every hour<br/>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Day of the Month, 1-31: * means every day of the month<br/>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The Month, 1-12: * means every month<br/>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Day of the Week, 0-7 (0 and 7 are both Sunday): * means every day<br/>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The Command: In this case, a command at/home/aspera/my_script.sh<br/>
<br/>
With older crontabs, like the one on legacy Solaris, this is mostly all that can be done. One variation is to use comma separated lists. Modern crontabs can use string names for days, and wildcards with increments. So, to create an entry that runsmy_script.sh every 5 minutes would be as follows on Linux:<br/>
<br/>
*/5 * * * * /home/aspera/my_script.sh<br/>
<br/>
The */5 notation in the first column means "every 5 minutes". To make this every 10 minutes, */10 is used. To do the same 5 minute interval on a Solaris system, try the following:<br/>
<br/>
0,5,10,15,20,25,30,35,40,45,50,55 * * * * /home/aspera/my_script.sh<br/>
