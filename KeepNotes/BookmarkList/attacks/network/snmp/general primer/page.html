<title>General Primer</title>
</head><body>SNMP – (Simple Network Management Protocol) – an application-layer protocol for managing TCP/IP based networks. SNMP runs over UDP (which runs over IP).<br/>
<br/>
MIB – (Management Information Base) – provides a standard representation of the SNMP agent’s available information and where it is stored.<br/>
<br/>
NMS – (Network Management Station) – A device designed to poll SNMP agents for information.<br/>
<br/>
SNMP Agent – a device running some software that understands the language of SNMP. Almost any network device could potentially run SNMP, but typically you will find SNMP agents running on internetworking devices (eg. routers, hubs, switches, bridges). Some operating systems (UNIX, Windows NT) can also run SNMP agents.<br/>
<br/>
The main problem with SNMP is that the authentication method (public and private community strings) is inherently weak, not to mention the fact the SNMP is based on UDP, which is prone to spoofing. So, we’ve got a weak protocol, often forgotten and misconfigured – a disaster just waiting to happen.<br/>
Just to get a taste of what kind on info SNMP can get, we’ll use snmpwalk – a linux based tool. (I’ve found Win32 ports for these tools, but I strongly suggest using Linux for this tutorial).<br/>
<br/>
We see that a simple walk on the standard MIB tree wield a whopping amount of information. By using specific vendor private mibs, more information can be found.<br/>
<br/>
However, a common misconception is that SNMP is “read only”, and that no actual changes can be made using SNMP. This couldn’t be further from the truth. The Community strings for SNMP can be brute forced, using a variety of tools.<br/>
<br/>
The Versions of SNMP<br/>
SNMPv1 and v2 do not respond when traffic is sent their way unless there is a valid community string in the message, a fact used by scanners like <a href="http://labs.portcullis.co.uk/application/onesixtyone/">&nbsp;onesixtyone </a>. So traditionally the theory is unless there's a known community string, the service running has a vulnerability or you can get in-line to sniff traffic, there's not a lot to get from SNMP services.<br/>
Turns out that SNMPv3 behaves differently from v1 and v2. Firstly the notion of using community strings for authentication is gone, replaced by username/passwords. Second the traffic can be encrypted to limit sniffing opportunites.<br/>
<br/>
Most tools will allow you to specify version, and be aware you may need to specify a specific version of 2 like 2c. </body></html>
