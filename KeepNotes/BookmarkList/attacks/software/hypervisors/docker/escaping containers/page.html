<title>Escaping Containers</title>
</head><body>Essentially Priv Esc, so all steps in addition to some of the following thoughts:<br/>
<br/>
&nbsp;<br/>
A user on a Docker host who has access to the docker group or privileges to sudo docker commands is effectively root (as you can do things like use docker to run a privilieged container or mount the root filesystem inside a container), which is why it's very important to control that right.<br/>
&nbsp;<br/>
Breaking out of a Docker container to the host is a different game and will be more or less difficult depending on a number of factors. Possible vectors include :-<br/>
&nbsp;<ul><li>Kernel vulnerabilities. Containers running on a host share the same kernel as the host, so if there's an exploitable issue in the kernel that may be used to break out of the container to the host</li>
<li>Bad configuration. If a container that you have access to is running with --privileged you're likely to be able to get access to the underlying host.</li>
<li>Mounted filesystems. If a container you have mounts a host filesystem, you can likely change items in that filesystem which could allow you to esclate privileges to the host.</li>
<li>Mounted Docker socket. A relatively common (and dangerous) practice in Docker containers is to mount the docker socket inside a container, to allow the container to understand the state of the docker daemon. This allows a trivial breakout to the host. More information <a href="https://raesene.github.io/blog/2016/03/06/The-Dangers-Of-Docker.sock/">here</a>&nbsp;</li>
</ul>

If you're looking for more information I'd recommend these whitepapers from NCC. <a href="https://www.nccgroup.trust/uk/our-research/abusing-privileged-and-unprivileged-linux-containers/">Abusing Privileged and Unprivileged Linux Containers</a>&nbsp;and <a href="https://www.nccgroup.trust/uk/our-research/understanding-and-hardening-linux-containers/">Understanding and Hardening Linix Containers</a>&nbsp;. There's also a presentation I did which covers some of this stuff <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQigvjSXMLw">here</a>.<br/>
&nbsp;<br/>
If you're interested in Docker hardening I'd also recommend having a look at the <a href="https://benchmarks.cisecurity.org/tools2/docker/CIS_Docker_1.13.0_Benchmark_v1.0.0.pdf">CIS Security standard</a>.<br/>
