<title>CSRF Via XHR / Fetch</title>
</head><body>CSRF via XHR/Fetch<br/>
It is also possible to issue CSRF requests via JavaScript on the malicious page. If a flawed CORS policy allows the attacker to set up a malicious page that is an allowed origin, with credentials allowed, then you really have a CORS abuse flaw first and foremost, and you can’t effectively protect against CSRF without addressing it. Part 1 of this series dealt with that, so let’s assume that the malicious page is NOT permitted access by CORS. In fact, let’s assume there’s no CORS policy at all, and Same-Origin Policy (SOP) applies. In this case, any request issued by JavaScript on the page will generate a response that the JavaScript will not be permitted to consume. Just as with classic CSRF, this is a blind attack, and therefore the same basic criteria applies for susceptibility. <br/>
<br/>
Additionally, the attack needs to be able to avoid a CORS prefetch, or else the malicious request will never be sent. Remember that pre-flights are NOT sent if all of the following are true:<br/>
<ul><li>The method is GET, POST, or HEAD</li>
<li>No custom request headers have been set</li>
<li>The content-type is &nbsp;text/plain, application/x-www-form-urlencoded, or multipart/form-data</li>
</ul>
<br/>
The effect is that if a valid JavaScript request can be created that meets the above criteria, the CORS policy will not prevent the server from handling it as a valid request. Same-Origin Policy will only prevent the JavaScript from reading the response. The XmlHttpRequest’s withCredentials or Fetch’s credentials settings, respectively, will allow the inclusion of cookies or HTTP Authorization headers, just like the classic CSRF requests automatically included. &nbsp;It’s up to the server-side of the application to identify and reject these requests.</body></html>
