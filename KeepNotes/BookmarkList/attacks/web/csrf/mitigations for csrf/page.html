<title>Mitigations For CSRF</title>
</head><body>There are a few strategies to defend against the attack, generally with the goal of ensuring only the requests originating from the actual legitimate application are accepted.<br/>
<br/>
<b>CSRF tokens</b>&nbsp;are one of the most common strategies, often available at the web framework level. <br/>
These add a random value (often in a hidden form field) to the legitimate page in the application. One version of this implementation is to have the server cache this token. When the server receives a request, it will then check that the token is included and matches what the server has cached. It’s essential that the token is uniquely associated to a specific session, or else the attacker may be able to acquire a valid token to include. <br/>
Another variant of this is to set the token in a cookie. Even though the CSRF request will include the cookie, this attack will not allow the attacker to read the cookie. As with the first example, the server will expect the body of the request to include the token, and then it will compare the token in the body against the token in the cookie. If they match, it’s treated as a valid request from the legitimate application. This approach alleviates the need to maintain CSRF token state on the server. <br/>
One more approach, particularly for a web service API, is to have the legitimate application(s) supply the token via custom header. This means every JavaScript request from the client will need to add that header, however it also means that it cannot be supplied without triggering a CORS pre-flight.<br/>
<br/>
<b>Credential re-prompts</b>&nbsp;effectively defeat the CSRF attack as well. Consider the common case of requiring the current password when assigning a new password. Because the attacker does not known the current password (if they did, they wouldn’t need the CSRF attack), they can’t supply that as part of the request.<br/>
<br/>
<b>Origin and Referrer checking</b>&nbsp;is yet another strategy. As I outlined in the CORS post, the browser will automatically include an Origin header (and usually referrer header, although there are some ways of manipulating it) &nbsp;on cross-site requests. While a custom script can easily spoof the Origin, validating these headers as matching the legitimate application is enough to solve the actual attack scenario since it required cookies/auth set in the victim’s browser. A bonus is that this strategy can often be built-into your CORS logic. If it’s a cross-origin request and the origin is not allowed (e.g. you would not reflect it in you access-control-allow-origin header), reject the request.<br/>
<br/>
<b>Out-of-Band required fields like a CAPTCHA</b>&nbsp;can effectively act like a CSRF token since they require input that is unknown to the attacker.<br/>
<br/>
<b>Multi-stage transactions</b>&nbsp;are more difficult to attack via CSRF. In particular, if there are multiple requests required and each one requires value(s) from the response to the previous request, the attacker has no means of obtaining those values. For example, if you fill out the create a user form, and you are directed to a confirmation page that prompts: are you sure you want to create this user? [y/n], and that confirmation form has an unpredictable transaction_id that the attacker wouldn’t know to be able to supply.<br/>
<br/>
Best practices mitigate some of the risk as well:<br/>
<ul><li>If you’re expecting a JSON payload, validate that the content-type is set to application/json. This immediately means that regular HTML forms can’t produce a well-formed JSON body, and JavaScript-based requests will be CORS pre-flighted.</li>
<li>HTTP Get requests often can’t practically have CSRF protection. If they follow the best practice of not mutating data or application state, they’re inherently not susceptible to CSRF.</li>
</ul>
<br/>
<b>SameSite cookies work, but only when they are supported</b>. The reason I don’t like to recommend SameSite as an anti-CSRF measure is that unsupported browsers are still widely used, and will just ignore the flag.<br/>
https://caniuse.com/#search=samesite<br/>
I generally lean toward combining more than one solution, and certainly if you know you’re not expecting cross-site requests, using SameSite on your cookies could be one of the solutions. I just feel that in most cases it’s insufficient to trust on its own. Anyone using IE10, for example. would be completely unprotected against CSRF if the SameSite flag was the only defense.</body></html>
