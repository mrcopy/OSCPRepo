</head><body>CORS (cross-origin resource sharing) is actually a policy that loosens a security control called the Same-Origin Policy, or SOP for short. Therefore, in order to understand CORS, we must first understand the SOP.<br/>
<br/>
The most common way to implement a CORS policy is to check the origin request header against a whitelist or pattern-match (e.g. regex) first, then include the access-control-allow-origin only if the origin header met the whitelisting criteria. &nbsp;If we don’t include access-control-allow-origin in the response, it’s not an allowed origin, and the Same-Origin Policy will keep the JavaScript in the requesting application from being able to access the response.<br/>
<br/>
It’s worth noting that the wildcard access-control-allow-origin:* is sometimes used to allow general public access. This is much less concerning than a reflected origin, because access-control-allow-credentials: true will not be enforced with the wildcard origin. In other words, credentials are never allowed with a wildcard origin.</body></html>
