<title>Understanding SOP</title>
</head><body>SOP is a policy that prevents JavaScript code from getting or setting properties on a resource coming from a different origin. <br/>
<br/>
The browser uses: protocol, hostname, and port. All of them must match when determining origin access. <br/>
<br/>
SOP only applies to the actual code of a script. It is still possible to include (lower-risk) external resrources by using HTML tags like img, script, iframe, object, and so on. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Certain types of requests are considered lower-risk and are therefore allowed to be cross-origin by default. A few examples are the HTTP Get request generated when an &lt;img&gt; or &lt;script&gt; tag is handled by the HTML rendering engine. Another example is a standard HTML &lt;form&gt; submission. These are generally considered safe because the content is not sensitive or is not directly exposed to the page that called them. In the classic cross-origin form POST scenario, as soon as the form is submitted, the browser essentially navigates to the domain that was submitted to anyway. The response is never passed back to the page that initiated the call, unless the server processing the request explicitly redirects the browser back there.<br/>
<br/>
Other types of request are more high-risk, and are subject to the same origin policy. Typically, these are the XMLHttpRequest (XHR) or more recently the fetch JavaScript APIs. These allow the script executing on the current page to issue HTTP requests and to receive the responses to those requests. One of these APIs, usually XHR, also underpin any library-specific implementations of issuing HTTP requests via browser-based JavaScript, such as jQuery’s $.ajax function. Because these fall under Same-Origin Policy, the browser enforces some security around them.<br/>
<br/>
For simple requests, the browser issues the request, but blocks the response from being handed to the JavaScript through low-level code, if the request was sent to a server at a different origin than the current page. <br/>
<br/>
The origin is defined as the unique combination of protocol (http or https), hostname or IP address, and port number. <br/>
<br/>
XHR and Fetch requests include an origin header showing the origin of the page issuing the request. For more complex requests, such as those with less common HTTP methods or those with custom headers, a CORS preflight request would be sent first. But let’s set preflights aside for the moment and elaborate on the more simple case.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Example:<br/>
What if we want, for example, our https://myapplication.secureideas.com modern web app to interact with https://api.professionallyevil.com? The Same-Origin Policy is in our way. It’s preventing our application from being able to receive responses from the API. And that’s where the CORS policy comes in. We can loosen our enforcement of same-origin policy by including response headers such as:<br/>
<br/>
access-control-allow-origin: https://myapplication.secureideas.com<br/>
<br/>
This tells the browser that it can make an exception to the Same-Origin Policy if it’s issuing a request from https://myapplication.secureideas.com. In other words, it’s okay to pass the response to the JavaScript. This is a CORS policy, with access-control-allow-origin being the most common CORS header. <br/>
<br/>
Now, at this stage, there’s potentially one problem if our API relies on Authentication request headers or on cookies to establish the requestor’s identity. They will not be included in the XHR or fetch request by default. And if we specify the withCredentials flag that instructs the browser to include auth headers and cookies, the Same-Origin Policy kicks in again and refuses to pass the response to the JavaScript. Because allowing the origin is not enough to include these credentials, the response needs to contain another CORS policy header:<br/>
<br/>
access-control-allow-credentials: true<br/>
<br/>
This means it’s okay for the request to be issued with credentials (HTTP authentication request headers and cookies), from the allowed origin. After adding that header to the response, the JavaScript can now issue requests from myapplication.secureideas.com to api.professionallyevil.com, including HTTP Authentication request headers and cookies (which the browser attaches without exposing to myapplication.secureideas.com), and it can receive and handle the responses. Or, to summarize, myapplication can now make authenticated API calls to api.professionallyevil.com as long the user has authenticated.<br/>
