</head><body>XAMPP is a package containing several pieces of software. From <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XAMPP">wikipedia</a>:<br/>
XAMPP is a free and open-source cross-platform web server solution stack package developed by Apache Friends, consisting mainly of the Apache HTTP Server, MariaDB database, and interpreters for scripts written in the PHP and Perl programming languages. Since most actual web server deployments use the same components as XAMPP, it makes transitioning from a local test server to a live server possible. <br/>
<br/>

Letter &#09;Meaning<br/>

A &#09;&#09;Apache or its expanded form, Apache HTTP Server<br/>
M &#09;&#09;MariaDB (formerly: MySQL)<br/>
P &#09;&#09;PHP<br/>

<br/>
MySQL was replaced with MariaDB on 2015-10-19 and beginning with XAMPP versions <b>5.5.30</b>&nbsp;and <b>5.6.14</b>, effectively altering the meaning of the acronym. <br/>
<br/>
Wikipedia also has a table of xampp versions and what version of each software is included with it. <br/>
<br/>
The best thing to do (if possible) is to install the version of XAMPP the target has to understand the versions and directory structure. </body></html>
