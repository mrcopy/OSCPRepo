<title>Intercept Browser-Managed Passwords</title>
</head><body>In-browser password managers are a popular tool for simplifying account management across multiple websites. They operate by detecting HTML forms that include a password field, and offering the user to save the entered credentials in a browser-operated password jar. The stored passwords are then automatically inserted into any plausibly-looking forms encountered within a matching origin. In Chrome and Firefox, this autocompletion requires no user interaction; in Internet Explorer and Opera, an additional gesture may be required.<br/>
<br/>
The attacker may obtain stored passwords by leveraging a markup injection vulnerability to present the browser with a well-structured password form. In absence of the ability to execute scripts, the next step is browser- and application-specific:<br/>
<ul><li>In browsers such as Chrome and Opera, the actual URL to which the form submits (the action parameter) may be selected arbitrarily and may point to an attacker-controlled server. This offers a very straightforward exfiltration opportunity.</li>
<li>In most other browsers, it is possible to present a form that specifies GET instead of POST as the submission mode (the method parameter), and submit the credentials to a carefully selected same-site destination. That destination may be a page that links to or includes subresources from third-party sites (thus leaking the credentials in the Referer header); or a page that echoes back query parameters in the response body, and is vulnerable to any of the previously discussed exfiltration methods.</li>
</ul>
