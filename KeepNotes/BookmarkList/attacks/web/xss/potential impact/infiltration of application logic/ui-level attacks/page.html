<title>UI-Level Attacks</title>
</head><body>It should be apparent that the ability to inject passive markup is often sufficient to disrupt the underlying logic of the targeted application. The other important and frequently overlooked aspect of the security of any web application is the integrity of its user interface.<br/>
<br/>
In analyzing the impact of markup injection vulnerabilities, we must consider the possibility that the attacker will use stylesheets, perhaps combined with legacy HTML positioning directives, to overlay own content on top of legitimate UI controls and alter their apparent purpose, without affecting the scripted behaviors associated with user actions. For example, it may be possible to skin a document sharing dialog as a harmless and friendly notification, without changing the underlying semantics of the "OK" button displayed therein.<br/>
<br/>
Although the most recent specification of CSP disallows inline stylesheets to protect against an unrelated weakness, the attacker is still free to load any other standalone stylesheet found within any of the whitelisted origins, and reuse any of the offered classes normally used to construct the legitimate UI; therefore, such an attack is very likely to be feasible.<br/>
<br/>
Another area of concern is that the occurrence of a click or other simple UI action is not necessarily indicative of informed consent. The attacker may trick the user into unwittingly interacting with the targeted application by predicting the timing of a premeditated click, and rapidly transitioning between two documents or two simultaneously open windows; this problem is one of the unsolved challenges in browser engineering, and is discussed in more detail on <a href="http://lcamtuf.blogspot.com/2011/12/x-frame-options-or-solving-wrong.html">this</a>&nbsp;page. The context-switching attack may be used separately, or may be leveraged in conjunction with any of the exfiltration or state change techniques discussed here to work around the normally required degree of interaction with the vulnerable page.</body></html>
