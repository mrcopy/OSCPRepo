<title>Abuse of JSONP</title>
</head><body>Abuse of JSONP (CSP-specific)<br/>
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSONP">Abuse of JSONP</a>&nbsp;(JSON with padding) is a popular method for building JavaScript APIs. JSONP interfaces are frequently used to integrate with services provided by trusted third-party sites (e.g., to implement search or mapping capabilities), as well as to retrieve private first-party data (in this case, an additional Referer check or an XSRF token is commonly used).<br/>
<br/>
Regardless of the purpose, the integration with any JSONP API is achieved by including a script reference similar to this:<br/>
<br/>
&lt;script src="http://example.com/find_store.php?zipcode=90210&amp;callback=parse_response"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;<br/>
<br/>
In response, the server dynamically generates a script structured roughly the following way:<br/>
<br/>
parse_response({ 'zipcode': '90210', 'results': [ '123 Evergreen Terrace', ... ]});<br/>
<br/>
The inclusion of this response as a script results in the invocation of a client-specified callback - parse_response(...) - in the context of the calling page.<br/>
<br/>
Any CSP-enabled website that either offers JSONP feeds to others, or utilizes them internally, is automatically prone to a flavor of return-oriented programming: the attacker is able to invoke any functions of his choice, often with at least partly controllable parameters, by specifying them as the callback parameter on the API call:<br/>
<br/>
&lt;script src='/editor/sharing.js'&gt;: &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;← Legitimate script<br/>
&nbsp; function set_sharing(public) {<br/>
&nbsp; &nbsp; if (public) request.access_mode = AM_PUBLIC;<br/>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; else request.access_mode = AM_PRIVATE;<br/>
&nbsp; &nbsp; ...<br/>
&nbsp; }<br/>
<br/>
&lt;script src='/search?q=a&amp;call=set_sharing'&gt;: &nbsp; &nbsp;← Injected JSONP call<br/>
&nbsp; set_sharing({ ... })<br/>
<br/>
In addition, any JSONP interface that does not filter out parentheses or other syntax elements in the name of the callback function - a practice that has no special security consequences under normal operating conditions - will be vulnerable to an even more straightforward attack:<br/>
<br/>
&lt;script src='/search?q=a&amp;call=alert(1)'&gt;&lt;/script&gt;<br/>
<br/>
