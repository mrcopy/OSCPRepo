<title>Abuse of Special Privileges</title>
</head><body>In addition to the attacks on application logic and the apparent function of UI controls, markup injection vulnerabilities may be leveraged to initiate certain privileged actions in a way that bypasses normal security restrictions placed on untrusted sites. These attacks are of less interest from the technical perspective, but are of significant practical concern.<br/>
<br/>
Examples of privilege-based attacks that may be delivered over passive HTML markup include:<br/>
<ul><li>Updating <a href="http://www.opensearch.org/Specifications/OpenSearch/1.1">OpenSearch</a>&nbsp;registrations associated with the site to subvert the search integration capabilities integrated into the browser.</li>
<li>Initiating the download and installation of extensions, themes, or updates (if the compromised origin is recognized as privileged by one of the mechanisms built into the browser).</li>
<li>Instantiating site-locked plugins or ActiveX extensions with attacker-controlled parameters.</li>
<li>Starting file downloads or providing misleading and dangerous advice to the user; the user is trained to make trust decisions based on the indicators provided in the address bar, so this offers a qualitative difference in comparison to traditional phishing.</li>
</ul>
