<title>General Primer</title>
</head><body>The 'technology' flow started with javascript and became 'mitigated' by same-origin policy, but scripts and JSONP don't follow it (ie, cross-domain!). <br/>
<br/>
XSSI is cross site script inclusion. <br/>
You don't want cross-origin leakage. Ever, really. Cross-origin policy can help whitelist all of this. Cross-site script inclusion is where an attacker includes a script from another site, and gains access to all of the information that script can access. <br/>
<br/>
Scripts can include sensitive data. Bad practice. Scripts are allowed to be included cross-site. It's how javascript works. But the inclusion of sensitive data should never be there. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
"Ambient authority" <br/>
Ambient authorities can help track if you're still logged into a site. Cookies are a basic example. Some use cross-site script inclusion to track. <br/>
