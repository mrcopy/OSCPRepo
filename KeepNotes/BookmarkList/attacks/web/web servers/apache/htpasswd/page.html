.htpasswd is used to create and update the flat-files used to store usernames and password for basic authentication of HTTP users. If htpasswd cannot access a file, such as not being able to write to the output file or not being able to read the file in order to update it, it returns an error status and makes no changes. <br/>
<br/>
Resources available from the Apache HTTP server can be restricted to just the users listed in the files created by htpasswd. This program can only manage usernames and passwords stored in a flat-file. It can encrypt and display password information for use in other types of data stores, though. To use a DBM database see <a href="https://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.4/programs/dbmmanage.html">dbmmanage</a>&nbsp;or <a href="https://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.4/programs/htdbm.html">htdbm</a>.<br/>
&nbsp;<br/>
htpasswd encrypts passwords using either bcrypt, a version of MD5 modified for Apache, SHA1, or the system's crypt() routine. Files managed by htpasswd may contain a mixture of different encoding types of passwords; some user records may have bcrypt or MD5-encrypted passwords while others in the same file may have passwords encrypted with crypt().<br/>
&nbsp;<br/>
This manual page only lists the command line arguments. For details of the directives necessary to configure user authentication in <a href="https://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.4/programs/httpd.html">httpd</a>&nbsp;see the Apache manual, which is part of the Apache distribution or can be found at <a href="http://httpd.apache.org">http://httpd.apache.org/</a>.<br/>

&nbsp;htpasswd – The file to store passwords &nbsp; Htpasswd files are used when password protecting a website or a directory using HTTP Authentication and Apache’s htaccess files. &nbsp;<br/>
The htpasswd file contains username in plain text (unencrypted) and a hashed (encrypted) password. Here’s an example:<br/>
&nbsp;andreas:$apr1$dHjB0/..$mkTTbqwpK/0h/rz4ZeN8M0 john:$apr1$IHaD0/..$N9ne/Bqnh8.MyOtvKU56j1 &nbsp;<br/>
Each line contains a username and a password separated by a colon ":". You can not see the actual passwords as they are hashed (encrypted) using a complex algorithm. The default algorithm is different from platform to platform. On Windows the passwords are hashed using MD5, and on Linux its based on a system function called “crypt()”. The htpasswd generator on this site uses MD5 which means that the hashed passwords can be used on both Windows and Linux.<br/>
&nbsp;Filename <br/>
Normally the htpasswd file is named .htpasswd, but you are actually free to name your password file what every you like. It is perfectly valid to use a name like "passwords.txt" which may seem more appealing to Windows users. However there is one catch. Apache is usually configured to prevent access to .ht* files – starting with ".ht". If you name your password file "passwords.txt", a user can access it, and retrieve all valid usernames. Since the passwords are hashed he can’t use them directly, but it will help him gain access using brute force.<br/>
&nbsp;<br/>
<b>It is therefore recommended to name a password file .htpasswd.</b><br/>
&nbsp;Generating password <br/>
Hashed passwords can be generated with the <a href="http://httpd.apache.org/docs/current/programs/htpasswd.html">command-line tool htpasswd</a>&nbsp;(htpasswd.exe on Windows) which is part of a normal Apache installation. You can also create passwords using the <a href="http://www.htaccesstools.com/htpasswd-generator/">htpasswd generator</a>&nbsp;on this site, or <a href="http://www.htaccesstools.com/articles/create-password-for-htpasswd-file-using-php/">create passwords yourself using PHP</a>.<br/>
