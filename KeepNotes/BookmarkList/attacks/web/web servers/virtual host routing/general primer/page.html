<title>General Primer</title>
</head><body>Many times you know the IP of a webserver and you attempt to go to &lt;IP&gt;:80 in a browser. Virtual Host routing may be preventing you from seeing all the applications/data on that web server.<br/>
<br/>
You can check some of the following places to build a list of 'names' to try to access:<br/>
Certificates (see which domains the cert is valid for)<br/>
NSlookup / dig nameservers (to see which domains / sites are in the zone (root or otherwise))<br/>
Virtual Host scanning (brute force to see which subdomains are valid)<br/>
Domain Name of the machine (ie if the ip is 10.10.10.10, but its name is bank, try bank.&lt;domain&gt;:80 in your browser)<br/>
Append full protocol (ie http:// http://www. etc)<br/>
<br/>
You can add these values in your /etc/hosts file in order to access them more easily<br/>
If there is a nameserver resolving these names, you can add it into your /etc/resolv.conf file to access them more easily</body></html>
