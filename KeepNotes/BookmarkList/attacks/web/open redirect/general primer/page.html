</head><body>Open redirect is a vulnerability which, in my opinion, tends to be overvalued. To cite Google from their <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/bughunteruniversity/nonvuln/open-redirect">Bug Hunter University</a>&nbsp;page:<br/>
<br/>
Open redirectors take you from a Google URL to another website chosen by whoever constructed the link. Some members of the security community argue that the redirectors aid phishing, because users may be inclined to trust the mouse hover tooltip on a link and then fail to examine the address bar once the navigation takes place.<br/>
<br/>
There are several ways to attack redirects whether it is an open direct, the page doesn't check its referrer, or otherwise. Redirects can be dangerous by forwarded the user to an unintended location or even given the user access to a page they normally wouldn't have access to (since the domain is referring itself OR to somewhere external to the domain). <br/>
