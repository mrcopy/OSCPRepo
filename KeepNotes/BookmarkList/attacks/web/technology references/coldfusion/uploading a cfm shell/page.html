<title>Uploading A CFM Shell</title>
</head><body>This process is analogue to the process when you, for example, deploy a JSP shell, but the way you do it is a little different. <br/>
We need to go to the "Debugging &amp; Loging / Scheduled Taks" menu element and add a scheduled task that would download our CFML script from our webserver to the ColdFusion server’s webroot. Make sure you schedule the deployment to some reasonable time, so 5-10 minutes from your current time - no one likes to wait for free shells, right?<br/>
<br/>
Here is an example on how it looks like:<br/>

<br/>
You can find a few CFML shells for example <a href="http://code.google.com/p/fuzzdb/source/browse/trunk/web-backdoors/cfm/?r=180">here</a>. I like to use this one from <a href="http://grutz.jingojango.net/exploits/cfexec.cfm">Kurt Grutzmacher</a>:<br/>
Shell from <a href="https://ultimatepeter.com/tutorial-coldfusion-exploit-hack-big-sites-with-ease/">Ultimatepeter.com</a>&nbsp;is way better. Also below. Need to fix the commas, quotes, and comment lines. echo -n "newpass" | md5sum for a new password.<br/>
<br/>
If the target is running enterprise, you can also do a jsp shell (depends on shell's java version requirements). <br/>
<br/>
And it looks like this once it is uploaded (I had to use the Options fields to fit in the screenshot):<br/>
