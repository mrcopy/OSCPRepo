</head><body><b>Defining the Attack Surface of an Application</b><br/>
The Attack Surface describes all of the different points where an attacker could get into a system, and where they could get data out.<br/>
<br/>
The Attack Surface of an application is:<br/>
<ul><li>the sum of all paths for data/commands into and out of the application, and</li>
<li>the code that protects these paths (including resource connection and authentication, authorization, activity logging, data validation and encoding), and</li>
<li>all valuable data used in the application, including secrets and keys, intellectual property, critical business data, personal data and PII, and</li>
<li>the code that protects these data (including encryption and checksums, access auditing, and data integrity and operational security controls).</li>
</ul>
<br/>
You overlay this model with the different types of users - roles, privilege levels - that can access the system (whether authorized or not). Complexity increases with the number of different types of users. But it is important to focus especially on the two extremes: unauthenticated, anonymous users and highly privileged admin users (e.g. database administrators, system administrators).<br/>
<br/>
Group each type of attack point into buckets based on risk (external-facing or internal-facing), purpose, implementation, design and technology. You can then count the number of attack points of each type, then choose some cases for each type, and focus your review/assessment on those cases.<br/>
<br/>
With this approach, you don't need to understand every endpoint in order to understand the Attack Surface and the potential risk profile of a system. Instead, you can count the different general type of endpoints and the number of points of each type. With this you can budget what it will take to assess risk at scale, and you can tell when the risk profile of an application has significantly changed.</body></html>
