<title>SSH Dynamic Reverse Port Forward</title>
</head><body>So you have access to a machine, but it's not ssh access and ssh isn't open from the outside. Nifty trick:<br/>
<br/>
Step1: create a dynamic port forward to localhost<br/>
Step2: reverse forward the newly created dynamic port to your attacking machine<br/>
<br/>
This does only work if the target machine &nbsp;has an ssh server and is running<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Newer versions of SSH:<br/>
OpenSSH 7.6 introduced reverse dynamic proxy as a native option. It is implemented entirely in the client, so the server does not need to be updated.<br/>
ssh -R 1080 server<br/>
<br/>
