<title>Jerry - Tomcat WAR</title>
</head><body>Keeping this general until the machine is retired:<br/>
<br/>
Ensure you have the latest "up-to-date" information regarding wordlists. Default or otherwise.<br/>
<br/>
War files need to be unzipped when they are deployed, and you need to know where to go. If using msfvenom, make sure to:<br/>
jar -xvf your_war.war<br/>
<br/>
and make note of the shell.jsp page (msfvenom makes it a random generated file name). Navigate there once your war is deployed and started.<br/>
<br/>
Machine is now retired, but nothing really 'out of the ordinary' on this box. </body></html>
