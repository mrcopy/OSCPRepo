tftp&gt; get file<br/>
Error code 1: Could not find fild 'C:\file'<br/>
<br/>
We know we're in C:\ as the root!<br/>
<br/>
You can try underscore instead of spaces, ie: documents_and_settings<br/>
Alternatively, neat trick with abbreviated names. If you put in the first 6 chars followed by ~1, it will resolve to the first item that matches that name:<br/>
tftp&gt; get /DOCUME~1<br/>
Error code 1: Access to the path 'C:\Documents and Settings' is denied<br/>
<br/>
Continues for ~2, etc, etc. <br/>
So Programs Files is: PROGRA~1<br/>
Program Files (x86) is: PROGRA~2<br/>
<br/>
neat!<br/>
<br/>
With the above enumeration, we are against a windows XP machine 32 bit<br/>
How to get code execution?<br/>
<br/>
For older machines, MOF is the answer (ie STUXNET)<br/>
<br/>
Analysis of psexec.rb from metasploit, 3 methods to exec<br/>
Connects to smb ADMIN$, embeds payload in service, and starts<br/>
Connects to smb ADMIN$, calls file at a location<br/>
MOF upload<br/>
<br/>
Analysis of mof_upload method<br/>
Expects the share to be ADMIN$<br/>
Drops the payload in C:\windows\system32\&lt;payload.exe&gt;<br/>
Creates a MOF and uploads to C:\windows\system32\wbem\mof\&lt;mof_name&gt;<br/>
<br/>
MOFs are auto executed! <br/>
Essentially, this MOF execution is adding filter and a consumer to WMI and executing commands. This was generally unexplored before STUXNET, but now you find find malicious WMI providers openly. <br/>
<br/>
two great resources for WMI/MOF:<br/>

<br/>
Note that on newer Windows OSes (VISTA+), MOF files are no longer autocompiled<br/>
<br/>
You can use a copy of metasploit module exploit/windows/tftp/distinct_tftp_traversal to exploit this. You'll need to take out the stuff regarding dir trav. <br/>
There are also two timers that can be configured, <br/>
1: while not tftp_client.complete<br/>
2: #Let the TFTP server idle a bit before sending another file<br/>
<br/>
Increase the timeout from 1 to something higher since there is a lot of data to send (depends on how big the MOF you want to send is).<br/>
