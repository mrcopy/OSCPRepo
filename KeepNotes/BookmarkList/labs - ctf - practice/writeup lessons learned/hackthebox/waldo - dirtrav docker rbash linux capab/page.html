<title>Waldo - DirTrav Docker rbash Linux Capabilities</title>
</head><body>Keeping this general until the machine is retired:<br/>
<br/>
Web is easy enough with a web proxy. <br/>
Take the time to throw EVERY list payload in the background while researching other methods of bypass. <br/>
<br/>
Enumeration is key for priv esc. Especially in Docker containers, may not be looking for root right away. Find other ways into low priv access. <br/>
Don't spend too much time analyzing binaries. Maybe 30 minutes top. Most of the "CTF" machines will have "obvious" ways of moving on.<br/>
<br/>
LinEnum is fantastic. If you don't know about why something is being flagged, research it. <br/>
Even if something seems simple and "couldn't possibly work" try it anyway. You never know what you may find.<br/>

Retired!<br/>
<br/>
Directory traversal is replacing unsafely and can be bypassed. Can be verified with a tool like DotDotPwn<br/>
str_replace is NOT recursively sanitizing the string (will only replace all instances of ../ one time)<br/>
Can list directories and files and find ssh key in /home/nobody/.ssh/.monitor as the 'nobody' user<br/>
<br/>
grep to remove comments and blank lines<br/>
| grep -v '^#' | grep .<br/>
<br/>
Once logged in, can see that user has sshd to local host (check the known_hosts file) and we get access as monior to the actual host using the same .monitor ssh key<br/>
<br/>
rbash!<br/>
Can write to an executable file '/home/monitor/app-dev/logMonitor<br/>
$red /bin/bash<br/>
w app-dev/logMonitor<br/>
q<br/>
<br/>
will write /bin/bash to logMonitor<br/>
<br/>
Can read more about capabilities with:<br/>
man capabilities<br/>
CAP_DAC_READ_SEARCH allows for:<br/>
&nbsp;Bypass file read permission checks and directory read and execute permission checks<br/>
&nbsp;Invoke open_by_handle_at(2);<br/>
&nbsp;use the linkat(2) AT_EMPTY_PATH flag to create a link to a file referred to by a file descriptor<br/>
