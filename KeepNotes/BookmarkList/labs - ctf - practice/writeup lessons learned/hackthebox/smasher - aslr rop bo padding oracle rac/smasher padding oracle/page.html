<title>Smasher Padding Oracle</title>
</head><body>Anytime there is an error message for a padding error, it is worth considering a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Padding_oracle_attack">padding oracle attack</a>. For a details primer, <a href="https://robertheaton.com/2013/07/29/padding-oracle-attack/">this</a>&nbsp;is a good read.<br/>
<br/>
A padding oracle attack is an attack against block ciphers where you have something (“an oracle”) that will respond to tell you if that padding on the cipher text is correct or not. It is important that there is a different error for a padding error than for an incorrect or invalid decryption. The most common case for this kind of thing is when you get an encrypted cookie in a web session, but there’s no reason we can’t do it here with this command line program.<br/>
<br/>
For block ciphers, the message will not always divide evenly by the block length. To get a full final block, typically padding is used. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Padding_(cryptography)#PKCS#5_and_PKCS#7">PKCS7</a>&nbsp;offers a padding scheme where the value of the pd bytes is equal to the number of padding bytes. That allows for disambiguation between padding bytes and true message bytes.<br/>
<br/>
The attack takes advantage of the fact that to decrypt a block, the cipher text is xored with the key to form the intermediate state. Then the intermediate state is xored with the previous block cipher text to get the plain text. This attack will allow me to find the intermediate state, and then, with that, it can find the plaintext.<br/>
<br/>
I’ll import a module from mwielgoszewski designed to implement padding oracle attacks, <a href="https://github.com/mwielgoszewski/python-paddingoracle">python-paddingoracle</a>. With this module, you simply pass it a socket, implement the oracle() function, and raise a BadPaddingException when there’s bad padding, and it handles the rest.<br/>
<br/>
My code looks like this:<br/>
<br/>
class PadBuster(PaddingOracle):<br/>
&nbsp; &nbsp; def __init__(self, pwnsock, **kwargs):<br/>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; self.r = pwnsock<br/>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; super(PadBuster, self).__init__(**kwargs)<br/>
<br/>
&nbsp; &nbsp; def oracle(self, data, **kwargs):<br/>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; if all([x == 0 for x in data[:15]]) and data[16] == 255:<br/>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; print('\n\n\n\n')<br/>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; os.write(1, "\x1b[3F")<br/>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; print(hexdump(data))<br/>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; self.r.recvuntil('Insert ciphertext:')<br/>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; self.r.sendline(b64encode(data))<br/>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; resp = self.r.recvline()<br/>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; if 'Invalid Padding' in resp:<br/>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; raise BadPaddingException()<br/>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; return<br/>
<br/>
log.info('Starting padding orcale attack')<br/>
pb = PadBuster(r)<br/>
plaintext = pb.decrypt(encdata, block_size=AES.block_size, iv=iv)<br/>
print('plaintext: {}'.format(plaintext))<br/>
r.close()<br/>
<br/>
I will pass the open pwn socket in on init, and the in the oracle function, receive until the prompt, then send data, then receive the response. If it says “Invalid Padding”, I raise the exception, or, otherwise, return nothing.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
If you watch the script run, you’ll see the script showing the cipher text, which in this case is two blocks. The second block isn’t changing. But the first block starts at all 00 except for the last byte FF, and it decrements that byte until it doesn’t get a padding error. Then, since it knows what the plain text should be in that case, it knows what the intermediate value for that byte is. But since it knows the intermediate value and the actual cipher text for the previous block, it can get the true plain text for that byte.</body></html>
