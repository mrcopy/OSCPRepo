<title>Labs Lessons Learned</title>
</head><body>XP is a pain to deal with because nothing new works. Even have to get an old version of accesschk. <br/>
Speaking of which, never forget /accepteula for sysinternals tools....<br/>
<br/>
| can be used for multiple commands in cmd.exe in older versions of Windows<br/>
<br/>
python (if it's installed) is just easier than working with vbs<br/>
<br/>
Don't bang your head against the wall for too long. Move on and come back if needed. <br/>
<br/>
Match the payload for the OS AND the language (if possible). IE, using ear and war files? java shell.<br/>
<br/>
Tools can enum a service differently. IE Web browser can show (and allow you to do) one thing, and native protocol (say ftp) can show (and allow you to do) something different. <br/>
Another lesson learned for tools...If you get too comfortable with one tool, you may miss something another tool will find. <br/>
&nbsp;&#09;Additional: using modules instead of enumerating directly, some edge cases may be missed in modules and you will need a more manual method<br/>
<br/>
Default creds for the service before searching for exploits. Conversely, always grab authenticated exploits when found in searching (even if you don't have cred access 'yet')<br/>
