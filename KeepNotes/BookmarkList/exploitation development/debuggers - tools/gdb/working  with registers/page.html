info registers <br/>
Print the names and values of all registers except floating-point and vector registers (in the selected stack frame). <br/>
&nbsp; &nbsp; info all-registers <br/>
Print the names and values of all registers, including floating-point and vector registers (in the selected stack frame). <br/>
&nbsp; info registers reggroup … <br/>
Print the name and value of the registers in each of the specified reggroups. The reggoup can be any of those returned by maint print reggroups (see <a href="https://sourceware.org/gdb/onlinedocs/gdb/Maintenance-Commands.html#Maintenance-Commands">Maintenance Commands</a>). <br/>
&nbsp; info registers regname … <br/>
Print the <i>relativized</i>&nbsp;value of each specified register regname. As discussed in detail below, register values are normally relative to the selected stack frame. The regname may be any register name valid on the machine you are using, with or without the initial ‘$’. <br/>

GDB has four “standard” register names that are available (in expressions) on most machines—whenever they do not conflict with an architecture’s canonical mnemonics for registers. The register names $pc and $sp are used for the program counter register and the stack pointer. $fp is used for a register that contains a pointer to the current stack frame, and $ps is used for a register that contains the processor status. For example, you could print the program counter in hex with <br/>
&nbsp; p/x $pc &nbsp;<br/>
or print the instruction to be executed next with <br/>
&nbsp; x/i $pc &nbsp;<br/>
or add four to the stack pointer<a href="https://sourceware.org/gdb/onlinedocs/gdb/Registers.html#FOOT11">11</a>&nbsp;with <br/>
&nbsp; set $sp += 4 </body></html>
