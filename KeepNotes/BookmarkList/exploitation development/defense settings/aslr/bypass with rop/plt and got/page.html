<title>PLT and GOT</title>
</head><body>To begin building our first ROP chain, we’ll get the address of the write syscall from the Procedure Linkage Table (PLT). The PLT is used to call external procedures/functions whose address isn’t known at the time of linking, and is left to be resolved by the dynamic linker at run time (recall that this binary is dynamically linked). The PLT is used in conjunction with the Global Offset Table (GOT) to implement dynamic linking. For more information on how dynamic libraries work in ELF files, please check out this <a href="https://www.technovelty.org/linux/plt-and-got-the-key-to-code-sharing-and-dynamic-libraries.html">fantastic post</a>&nbsp;on the subject.</body></html>
