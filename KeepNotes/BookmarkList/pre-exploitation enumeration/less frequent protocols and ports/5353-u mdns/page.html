<br/>
mDNS and DNS-SD are two protocols designed and used for Zero Configuration Networking (ZeroConf).<br/>
–Zero Conf = automatic IP configuration + host name resolution + target service discovery. <br/>
Used by many devices (Apple TV, Chromecast, home speakers, NAS devices, etc.).<br/>
<br/>
mDNS [RFC 6762] provides the ability to perform DNS-like operations on the local link. <br/>
–Using UDP port 5353 (source and destination).<br/>
DNS-SD [RFC 6763] allows clients to discoverinstances of a desired service in a domain using standard DNS queries.<br/>
–DNS-SD can be used with both unicast DNS and mDNS. <br/>
