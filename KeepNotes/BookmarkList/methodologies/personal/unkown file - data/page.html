<title>Unkown File / Data</title>
</head><body>One of the best ways to analyze these is to view the hex of the data. Google or wikipedia the first "magic bytes" to get an idea of what the data might be. <br/>
<br/>
Use strings on the data to see if there is any plain text keywords that you can Google. Example below. <br/>

Magic Byte examples<br/>
Example in Bandit 12. <br/>
Example in 21ltr: If we hexedit the file, we see a header of 1f 8b 08 00. &nbsp;A quick google search will show us that this is a GZ/TGZ file.<br/>
<br/>
You can either use vi and go into hex mode with: :%!xxd (and go back with :%!xxd -r)<br/>
<br/>

Strings Encrypted example<br/>
Example in De-Ice:<br/>
The file command told me it was just data, which didn’t help me much, so I tried strings to see if I could find anything readable in there: The string “Salted__n” looked interesting. I did a bit of Googling and found that “Salted__” is the first 8 bytes in an encrypted file created by the openssl command. </body></html>
