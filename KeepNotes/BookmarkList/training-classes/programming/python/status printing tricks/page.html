<title>Status Printing Tricks</title>
</head><body>I didn’t want 1000s of lines printed, but I wanted to see where things were. This was a good chance to learn about <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ANSI_escape_code#CSI_codes">CSI codes</a>. By printing “\x1b[nf”, it tells the console to go back to the beginning of the current line and then up n-1 lines (if n &gt; 1). So I can print the current hexdump over itself repeatedly, getting status, without crushing space.<br/>

os.write(1, "\x1b[3F")</body></html>
