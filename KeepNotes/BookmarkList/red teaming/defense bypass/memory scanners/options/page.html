</head><body>Raphael Mudge’s Cobalt Strike introduced a number of new features for ‘in-memory threat emulation’ such as:<br/>
<ul><li>Modifiable memory permissions for reflectively loaded DLLs (as opposed to just setting the pages to RWX)</li>
<li>Clean up of the initial memory allocation for reflectively loaded DLLs</li>
<li>‘Module stomping’ to bypass injected thread scanners so that beacon appears to be running from the legitimate text section of a DLL</li>
</ul>
<br/>
Other security researches have investigated bypassing injected thread scanners via techniques such as code caves or using SetThreadContext. In particular, see @_xpn_’s excellent blog on ‘<a href="https://blog.xpnsec.com/undersanding-and-evading-get-injectedthread/">Evading Get-InjectedThread</a>’.<br/>
