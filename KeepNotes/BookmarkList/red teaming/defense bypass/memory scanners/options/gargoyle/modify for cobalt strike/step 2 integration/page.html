<title>Step 2: Integration</title>
</head><body>The next step was to insert our code to stage/remove beacon on a timer as the primary payload of gargoyle. The approach taken to do this consisted of two phases:<br/>
<ul><li>Use <a href="http://www.exploit-monday.com/2013/08/writing-optimized-windows-shellcode-in-c.html">Matt Graeber’s technique for writing optimised Windows shellcode in C</a>&nbsp;to create a position independent code (PIC) version of the technique described in stage 1, henceforth referred to as ‘Metalgear’. This position independent payload contained the same logic as the technique outlined above but resolved Windows API functions by walking the linked list of loaded modules and comparing each function with a pre-calculated hash. It should be stressed that this is inefficient as it involves resolving function pointers every time the code is executed, whereas gargoyle allows us to pass function pointers via the ‘<a href="https://github.com/JLospinoso/gargoyle/blob/master/main.cpp">SetupConfiguration’ structure</a>.[5] However, for the purposes of this initial PoC (and as stated in the ‘Approach’ section) it was more efficient and simpler to write and test the Metalgear PIC separately.</li>
<li>Insert Metalgear into the gargoyle code (‘<a href="https://github.com/JLospinoso/gargoyle/blob/master/setup.nasm">setup.nasm</a>‘) that receives the ROP gadget/stack trampoline and replace the original payload which pops a message box. During the build process, gargoyle compiles ‘setup.nasm’ into shellcode and subsequently writes the compiled payload (‘setup.pic’) into memory as part of the PoC. As a result, this file contains all the logic to set up a WaitableTimer object, pop a message box, and set up the tail calls for WaitForSingleObject and VirtualProtectEx. Therefore, using IDA or WinDbg, we can carve up the compiled ‘setup.pic’ payload, remove the default call that pops a message box and substitute in our new Metalgear PIC.</li>
</ul>
<br/>
Two considerations were important for this phase. Firstly, as we are essentially hacking together different bits of shellcode we need to ensure that Metalgear can restore the exact same state of execution after it has finished running. This is required so that it does not corrupt the specially crafted stack and cause the tail of gargoyle to fail. This is a similar problem when attempting to hi-jack threads in remote processes via code caves (i.e. such as via the ‘SuspendThread / GetThreadContext / threadContext.Eip -&gt; code cave’ mechanism ).[6]<br/>
<br/>
As such, we can adopt a similar solution and use the PUSHAD/PUSHFD instructions to push the state of the registers and eflags to the stack, therefore saving the state of the registers before performing the ‘context switch’ to the Metalgear PIC. Once Metalgear has finished executing (and ensured that is has cleared the stack properly) we can use the POPAD/POPFD instructions to restore gargoyle to its original state of execution. The pseudo code block below demonstrates this approach and shows a modified 'setup.nasm' with the Metalgear payload included:<br/>

<br/>
Secondly, the Metalgear PIC compiled in this case was a single code block proceeded by a function that was used to resolve the hashes of WINAPI functions to function pointers (‘<a href="https://github.com/mattifestation/PIC_Bindshell/blob/master/PIC_Bindshell/GetProcAddressWithHash.h">GetProcAddressWithHash</a>’). As a consequence, by default the Metalgear PIC will crash once it is has finished executing unless it is guided to the gargoyle tail calls. This crash can be avoided in a couple of ways, either by adding a go to/relative jmp (via inline asm) to the gargoyle tail after execution has finished or by inlining any function calls<br/>
