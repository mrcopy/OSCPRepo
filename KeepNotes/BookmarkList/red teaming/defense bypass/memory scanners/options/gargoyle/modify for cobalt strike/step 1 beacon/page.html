<title>Step 1: Beacon</title>
</head><body>Step One: Staging/Removing Beacon<br/>
The following technique was used to accomplish the first stage of the approach:<br/>
<ul><li>Write the beacon payload into memory as ‘READ_ONLY’. This approach avoids having to constantly retrieve a payload over the network.</li>
<li>Find the ‘hidden’ beacon payload in read only memory, allocate new memory for it, copy it over, and create a new thread at the start of the reflective DLL. As part of the reflective loading process, another region of ‘RWX’ memory is subsequently allocated.</li>
<li>Keep a reference to the original allocation.</li>
<li>Memory scan to find the reflectively loaded memory allocation.</li>
<li>Thread scan to find the suspicious thread kicked off by beacon (the Windows kernel will record the starting address of this thread as beginning at the original memory allocation).</li>
<li>Sleep for a specified time period.</li>
<li>Terminate the thread belonging to beacon.</li>
<li>Un-map both the original allocation and the reflectively loaded allocation from memory.</li>
</ul>
<br/>
There are a number of limitations to this technique. Firstly, memory/thread scanning is not very efficient. However, as we do not control the bootstrapping shellcode or the exported reflective loader function that beacon uses for the <a href="https://github.com/stephenfewer/ReflectiveDLLInjection/blob/master/dll/src/ReflectiveLoader.c">reflective loading process</a>, we cannot easily obtain the pointer returned from the additional call to VirtualAlloc. Therefore, we do not know where beacon will load itself into memory at compile time nor can we easily obtain a handle to its main thread.<br/>
<br/>
Secondly, the TerminateThread WINAPI call is risky and generally should always be avoided if possible. Microsoft recommend that TerminateThread should only be used when the caller knows exactly what the target thread is doing, which in this case we do not. Different ways of requesting a thread to exit were investigated during this research but it was found that only terminate thread worked without causing a crash. However, while this worked for this PoC it has not been fully tested and may lead to unforeseen issues. A better approach may be to connect to beacon’s named pipe and send the exit command to instruct it to gracefully terminate.</body></html>
