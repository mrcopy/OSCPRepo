<title>Gargoyle</title>
</head><body>Gargoyle PoC technique for bypassing memory scanners by Josh Lospinoso. It enables hiding payloads in non-executable memory during periods of in-activity. To achieve this gargoyle implements the following steps:<br/>
<ul><li>Creates a Windows Waitable Timer Object that performs a call back to a user defined function (supplied via the ‘pfnCompletionRoutine’ parameter) after a specified time interval. The SetWaitableTimer function also enables a user to supply an argument, ‘lpArgToCompletionRoutine’, which is passed via the stack to the specified call back function.</li>
<li>In this case, the ‘pfnCompletionRoutine’ argument points to a specially crafted ROP gadget (‘pop *; pop esp; ret’) located in mshtml.dll and the ‘lpArgToCompletionRoutine’ parameter is a pointer to an attacker controlled stack.</li>
<li>Gargoyle then executes arbitrary code before setting itself as non-executable (via VirtualProtectEx) and returning to ‘WaitForSingleObjectEx’, which waits until the timer is triggered.</li>
<li>When the timer expires the Waitable Timer Object executes an Asynchronous Procedure Call (APC) to the specially crafted ROP gadget.</li>
<li>The ROP gadget will pop the argument supplied via ‘lpArgToCompletionRoutine’ into esp and pivot the stack.</li>
<li>The special stack contains a pointer (and arguments) to VirtualProtectEx, which results in a return call into VirtualProtectEx that marks the payload region as executable.</li>
<li>Gargoyle then returns to the start of the payload and execution starts again.</li>
</ul>
