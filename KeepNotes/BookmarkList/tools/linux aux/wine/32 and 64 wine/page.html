<br/>
It turns out that to make Wine run in 32-bit-only mode, one needs to:<br/>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Remove ~/.wine if it was already created in the 64-bit mode. (WARNING: This removes all stuff you have installed under Wine. Move it aside instead if you want to avoid dataloss.)<br/>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Set the WINEARCH environment variable to win32 i.e. export WINEARCH=win32<br/>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Then run wine (or winetricks, etc.)<br/>
<br/>
Conversely, 64 for 64 bit</body></html>
