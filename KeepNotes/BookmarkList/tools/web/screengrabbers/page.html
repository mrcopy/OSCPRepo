</head><body>Gathering Screenshots for http* services:<br/>
There are four ways (in my knowledge to do this)<ul><li>http-screenshot NSE:</li>
<li>Nmap has a NSE script <a href="https://github.com/SpiderLabs/Nmap-Tools/blob/master/NSE/http-screenshot.nse">http-screenshot</a>. This could be executed while running nmap. It uses wkhtml2image tool in the script. Sometimes, you may find that running this script takes a long time. It might be a good idea to gather all the http* running IP, Port and provide this information to wkhtml2image directly via scripting. You do have to install wkhtml2image and test with disable javascript and other options available.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/breenmachine/httpscreenshot">httpscreenshot</a>&nbsp;from breenmachine: httpscreenshot is a tool for grabbing screenshots and HTML of large numbers of websites. The goal is for it to be both thorough and fast which can sometimes oppose each other.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/ChrisTruncer/EyeWitness">Eyewitness</a>&nbsp;from Chris Truncer: EyeWitness is designed to take screenshots of websites, provide some server header info, and identify default credentials if possible.</li>
<li>Another method is to use <a href="https://code.google.com/p/java-html2image/">html2image</a>&nbsp;which is a simple Java library converts plain HTML markup to image and provides client-side image-map using HTML element.</li>
</ul>
