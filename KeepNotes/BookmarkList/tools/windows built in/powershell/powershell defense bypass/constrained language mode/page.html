Check if your session is running in ConstrainedLanguage:<br/>

<br/>
So what does Constrained Language constrain? <br/>
Constrained Language consists of a number of restrictions that limit unconstrained code execution on a locked-down system. These restrictions are:<br/>
&nbsp;<ul><li>PowerShell module script files must explicitly export functions by name without the use of wildcard characters.</li>
<li>This is to prevent inadvertently exposing powerful helper function not meant to be used publicly.</li>
<li>PowerShell module manifest files must explicitly export functions by name without the use of wildcards.</li>
<li>Again, to prevent inadvertent exposure of functions.</li>
<li>COM objects are blocked.</li>
<li>They can expose Win32 APIs that have likely never been rigorously hardened as part of an attack surface.</li>
<li>Only approved .NET types are allowed.</li>
<li>Many .NET types can be used to invoke arbitrary Win32 APIs. As a result only specific whitelisted types are allowed.</li>
<li>Add-Type is blocked.</li>
<li>It allows the creation of arbitrary types defined in different languages.</li>
<li>The use of PowerShell classes are disallowed.</li>
<li>PowerShell classes are just arbitrary C# type definitions.</li>
<li>PowerShell type conversion is not allowed.</li>
<li>Type conversion implicitly creates types and runs type constructors.</li>
<li>Dot sourcing across language modes is disallowed.</li>
<li>Dot sourcing a script file brings all functions, variables, aliases from that script into the current scope.</li>
<li>So this blocks a trusted script from being dot sourced into an untrusted script and exposing all of its internal functions.</li>
<li>Similarly, an untrusted script is prevented from being dot sourced into a trusted script so that it cannot pollute the trusted scope.</li>
<li>Command resolution automatically hides commands you cannot run.</li>
<li>For example, a function created in Constrained Language mode is not visible to script running in Full Language mode.</li>
<li>XAML based workflows are blocked since they cannot be constrained by PowerShell.</li>
<li>But script based workflows and trusted XAML based workflows shipped in-box are allowed.</li>
<li>The SupportedCommand parameter for Import-LocalizedData is disabled.</li>
<li>It allows additional commands prevented by Constrained Language.</li>
<li>Invoke-Expression cmdlet always runs in Constrained Language.</li>
<li>Invoke-Expression cannot validate input as trusted.</li>
<li>Set-PSBreakpoint command is blocked unless there is a system-wide lockdown through UMCI.</li>
<li>Command completers are always run in Constrained Language.</li>
<li>Command completers are not validated as trustworthy.</li>
<li>Commands and script run within the script debugger will always be run in Constrained Language if there is a system-wide lockdown.</li>
<li>The DSC Configuration keyword is disabled.</li>
<li>Supported commands and Statements are not allowed in script DATA sections.</li>
<li>Start-Job is unavailable if the system is not locked-down.</li>
<li>Start-Job starts PowerShell in a new process and if the system is not locked-down the new process runs in Full Language mode.</li>
</ul>
<br/>
As we can see, Constrained Language mode imposes some significant restrictions on PowerShell. Nevertheless, it remains a formidable and capable shell and scripting language. You can run native commands and PowerShell cmdlets and you have access to the full scripting features: variables, statements, loops, functions, arrays, hashtables, error handling, etc.<br/>
