</head><body>Windows Remote Management (WinRM) is a SOAP based protocol that can be used to remotely administer machines over the network. This is a handy tool for network admins that can also be used to automate tasks securely across multiple machines. However, it is fairly easy to misconfigure the service and/or abuse the service with legitimate account access. <br/>
<br/>
If WinRM is not configured for remote access, but the service is started, it listens for local requests on TCP port 47001. If you create listener it will still listen on 47001, but also on the default TCP ports 5985 (HTTP) and 5986 (HTTPS).</body></html>
