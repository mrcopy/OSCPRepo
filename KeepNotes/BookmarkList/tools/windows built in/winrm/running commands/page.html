<title>Running Commands</title>
</head><body>Once you’ve determined the service is running, you can try to run commands against the remote host with the Windows Remote Shell (winrs) command:<br/>
winrs -r:http://192.168.0.123:5985 -u:domainnameuseraccount “dir c:”<br/>
<br/>
You can also use this with HTTPS on port 5986, as that may be your only option. If you change the “dir c:” to “cmd” you will have a remote shell on the host. That should look something like this:<br/>
winrs -r:http://192.168.0.123:5985 -u:domainnameuseraccount “cmd”</body></html>
