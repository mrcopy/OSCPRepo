Vulnhub maybe kinda sorta like OSCP<br/>

<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/oscp/comments/9273hq/pentesterlabpro_vs_virtualhackinglabs_vs/">pentesterlabpro vs virtualhackinglabs vs hackthebox.eu vs vulnhub?</a>&nbsp; <br/>
<a href="https://virtualhackinglabs.com/">virtualhackinglabs.com</a>&nbsp;is probably the closest to what you need for OSCP. if you pay for at least a month, you get a coursebook that is really similar to the PWK coursebook. the differences will actually complement what you learn when you do the PWK course.<br/>
<br/>
i learned a lot about kali linux tools from doing ippSec walkthroughs on hackthebox. most of their boxes are more CTF, but if you get a VIP subscription you have access to all the retired machines and walkthroughs are only available for retired machines. although VHL is most similar to the OSCP lab, you may get more out of doing a lot of ippSec walkthroughs with HTB first.<br/>
<br/>
vulnhub has a mix of CTF and more realistic (?) machines. the big problem with vulnhub boxes is that i haven't found any windows machines. VHL and HTB both have windows boxes. i got a lot of value out of vulnhub walkthroughs, and the best part is that everything about vulnhub is free.<br/>
<br/>
from what i've done with pentesterlabpro, so far it's brilliant. however, it focuses more on web attacks. you could prepare for OSCP without it, imo.<br/>
