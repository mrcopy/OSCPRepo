$ scp * user () example org:/var/www/<br/>
<br/>
To exploit this command, in the directory we place these files.<br/>
<br/>
- - "-o" - SCP will interpret this file as the "-o" switch.<br/>
- - "ProxyCommand sh supercool.sh %h %p" - SCP will interpret this file's<br/>
name as the argument to the "-o" switch.<br/>
- - "supercool.sh" - The script that will run, containing the attacker's<br/>
code.<br/>
- - "zzz.txt" - Another file in the directory which serves no purpose for<br/>
the exploit.<br/>
<br/>
Inside "supercool.sh", we have a script that will do what "ProxyCommand"<br/>
is supposed to do, along with some malicious commands.<br/>
When the victim runs their scp command, it will appear successful:<br/>
<br/>
&nbsp; &nbsp; $ scp * user () example org:/var/www/<br/>
&nbsp; &nbsp; supercool.sh<br/>
&nbsp; &nbsp; zzz.txt<br/>
<br/>
But really, supercool.sh has executed, and we now have control of the<br/>
user's system.</body></html>
