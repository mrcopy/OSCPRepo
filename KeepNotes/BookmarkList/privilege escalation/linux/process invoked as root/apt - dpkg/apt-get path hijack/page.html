<title>Apt-get PATH Hijack</title>
</head><body>Alternatively, a potential path hijack with apt or apt-get<br/>
First determine where is apt-get by using 'whereis apt-get' or 'which apt-get'; <br/>
I will assume it's in /usr/bin/apt-get<br/>
Then create a file in /usr/local/bin/apt-get with this content:<br/>
<br/>
#!/bin/bash<br/>
# (commands to run before apt-get)<br/>
/usr/bin/apt-get "$@"<br/>
<br/>
now chmod +x /usr/local/bin/apt-get.<br/>
<br/>
This should survive all upgrades of the distribution but it should not change the behavior of apt-get (aside from running the command before doing anything else). As bonus, it could parse the command line arguments to only run the command when it is truly needed.</body></html>
