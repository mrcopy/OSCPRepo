<title>Encoding</title>
</head><body>MSFVenom can encode with a few options. Typical is:<br/>
&nbsp;-e x86/shikata_ga_nai<br/>
However, this is so well known that many AV block it<br/>
<br/>
Attempt to try other MSFVenom encoding options (on windows 10, I was unable to find suitable encoding chains for bypassing Defender). It is easier to generate payloads through/from other tools<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Veil framework can generated encoded payloads :<br/>
Lan<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Invoke-Obfuscation can generate encoded payloads for powershell<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Other options are surely available</body></html>
