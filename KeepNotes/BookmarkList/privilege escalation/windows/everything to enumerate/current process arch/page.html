<title>Current Process Arch</title>
</head><body>Due to a wider range of multi arch, tools WILL return different results based off of not only the Windows arch, but the CURRENT process arch (ie, the reverse shell you're running in). Be sure to enumerate both and attempt the exploit in both (unless otherwise noted)<br/>
<br/>
<b>Determine Current Process Arch (AMD64 = a 32 bit process under WOW64 mode):</b><br/>
&nbsp;If %PROCESSOR_ARCHITEW6432% == AMD64 ECHO 32 bit process<br/>
Or in PowerShell:<br/>
&nbsp;if ($env:PROCESSOR_ARCHITEW6432 -eq "AMD64") {"32 bit process"}<br/>
If it's not set!: you're either in a 32-bit proces on a 32-bit windows. OR you're in a 64-bit process on a 64-bit windows. <br/>
Check methods for determining Windows Arch.<br/>
<br/>
<b>System Folders</b><br/>
&nbsp; &nbsp; 64 bit versions of Windows have dynamic system folders C:\Windows\sys* to support both 64 and 32 bit programs.<br/>
&nbsp; &nbsp; PowerShell.exe, CMD.exe and many other programs are available as both 32 bit or 64 bit.<br/>
<br/>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <b>The dynamic sys folders will appear differently to a 32 bit session and a 64 bit session:</b><br/>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &#09;&#09;&#09;&#09;&#09;32 bit folder &#09;&#09;&#09;&#09;64 bit folder<br/>
&nbsp; &nbsp; 32 bit session &#09;C:\Windows\system32\ &#09;&#09;C:\Windows\sysNative\<br/>
&nbsp; &nbsp; 64 bit session &#09;C:\Windows\sysWOW64\ &#09;C:\Windows\system32\<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&nbsp; &nbsp; By default a 32 bit session will launch 32bit executables from C:\Windows\System32\ but you can still choose to launch 64 bit executables by specifying SysNative<br/>
&nbsp; &nbsp; By default a 64 bit session will launch 64bit executables also from C:\Windows\System32\ but you can still choose to launch 32 bit executables by specifying sysWOW64.<br/>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The sysNative folder is not visible to 64 bit processes or programs and cannot been seen in Windows Explorer.<br/>
<br/>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The PROCESSOR_ARCHITEW6432 environment variable. If it’s set, then you’re in a 32-bit process on 64-bit Windows, and must use SysNative. If it’s not set, then you’re either in a 32-bit process on 32-bit Windows, or in a 64-bit process on 64-bit Windows. In that case, you can use System32.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<b>Detect 64 bit processor hardware</b><br/>
&nbsp; &nbsp; In Vista and greater, you can use <b>WMIC os get osarchitecture</b>, or in <b>WMI Win32_ComputerSystem/OSArchitecture</b><br/>
&nbsp; &nbsp; There are a number of promising looking options in WMI and Systeminfo, but they all pertain to the OS not the CPU.<br/>
<br/>
<b>Detect a 64 bit Operating System</b><br/>
&nbsp; &nbsp; :: Installed OS<br/>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Set _os_bitness=64<br/>
&nbsp; &nbsp; IF %PROCESSOR_ARCHITECTURE% == x86 (<br/>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; IF NOT DEFINED PROCESSOR_ARCHITEW6432 Set _os_bitness=32<br/>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; )<br/>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Echo Operating System is %_os_bitness% bit<br/>

&nbsp; &nbsp; Windows 10 on ARM includes an x86-on-ARM64 emulation, so the possible values for PROCESSOR_ARCHITECTURE are: AMD64 or IA64 or ARM64 or (for 32 bit) x86<br/>
