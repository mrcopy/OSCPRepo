<title>General Primer</title>
</head><body>I suspect the majority of folk are familiar with the “Local Administrator Password Solution” (LAPS) from Microsoft. If not, the tl;dr is that it:<br/>
<ul><li>periodically changes the local admin account password</li>
<li>stores the password in a extended attribute of the computer object in AD</li>
<li>allows password read &amp; reset permissions to be delegated to AD users/groups</li>
</ul>
<br/>

Another LAPS Overview:<br/>
<br/>
LAPS (Local Administrator Password Solution) is a tool for managing local administrator passwords for domain joined computers. It stores passwords/secrets in a confidential attribute in the computer’s corresponding active directory object. LAPS eliminates the risk of lateral movement by generating random passwords of local administrators. LAPS solution is a Group Policy Client Side Extension (CSE) which is installed on all managed machines to perform all management tasks.<br/>
<br/>
Domain administrators and anyone who has full control on computer objects in AD can read and write both pieces of information (i.e., password and expiration timestamp). Password’s stored in AD is protected by ACL, it is up to the sysadmins to define who can and who cannot read the attributes. When transferred over the network, both password and time stamp are encrypted by kerberos and when stored in AD both password and time stamp are stored in clear text.<br/>
