</head><body>Routing protocols are used to determine the best path to reach a network. A router inspects the destination address of every incoming packet and then forwards it through one of its interfaces. <br/>
<br/>
A router performs a lookup in the routing table. The table can also contain an entry with the default address (0.0.0.0), which is used when the router receives a packet whose destination is an unknown network. <br/>
<br/>
There can be more than one way to reach a destination. During path discovery, routing protocols assign a metric to each link. This ensures that if two paths have the same number of hops, the fastest or cheapest route is selected.<br/>
